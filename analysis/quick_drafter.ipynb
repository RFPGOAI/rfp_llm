      "### Objective B: Calculate AMI Using Alternative Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Introduction\n",
      "Community Attributes Inc. (CAI), leveraging its expertise in data storytelling, economic analysis, and strategic planning, proposes to undertake a comprehensive assessment of Area Median Income (AMI) calculations using alternative methodologies. This assessment aims to provide our clients with a deeper understanding of the economic landscape across various regions in Washington, from legislative districts to metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data Collection\n",
      "CAI will collect up-to-date data on income, demographics, and housing markets. Data sources will include the U.S. Census Bureau, HUD, and local government databases, ensuring accuracy and relevancy. The data will be segmented by legislative districts as well as metro and non-metro areas to maintain precise and localized insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Methodologies for Alternative AMI Calculation\n",
      "1. **Geometric Mean Method**: Unlike the traditional arithmetic mean which can be skewed by extreme values, the geometric mean provides a more balanced midpoint of income distribution, potentially offering a more realistic threshold of median income in highly disparate economic environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adjusted Household Size Weighting**: This method recalculates AMI considering the variance in household sizes across different regions, acknowledging that economic needs differ with family size and composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) Method**: Adjusts the AMI based on regional variations in the cost of living, providing a nuanced view that reflects the economic reality faced by residents in different areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data Source and Accuracy\n",
      "- **U.S. Census Bureau (2021)**: Provides demographic and economic data crucial for baseline calculations.\n",
      "- **HUD Data Sets (2022)**: Offers specific income and housing data utilized in traditional AMI calculations, serving as a benchmark for comparison.\n",
      "- **Local Economic Reports (2023)**: Recent economic reports from local municipalities to capture the most current economic shifts, particularly useful for the COLA method.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Presentation of Results\n",
      "- **Comparison Tables**: Using the CAI Live platform, we will generate dynamic comparison tables that illustrate the outcomes of each alternative AMI calculation method. These tables will detail the AMI for different household sizes and for specified geographic areas, including both currently used areas and new segments based on legislative districts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Impact Analysis**: Each table will also indicate the number of individuals who shift in or out of income eligibility brackets under each alternative method, providing a clear picture of the potential impact of adopting different AMI calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Expected Outcomes and Impact\n",
      "The alternative AMI calculations will potentially uncover significant variations in income eligibility, particularly in areas experiencing rapid economic changes or those with diverse household compositions. By providing a multi-faceted view of AMI, stakeholders can make more informed decisions regarding housing affordability, allocation of resources, and economic policy making.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Questions for Further Clarification:**\n",
      "- Are there specific legislative districts where stakeholders are particularly concerned about the accuracy of current AMI calculations?\n",
      "- Is there a preference among stakeholders for more frequent updates to AMI calculations to reflect rapid economic changes?\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Conclusion\n",
      "By applying these alternative methods to calculate AMI, Community Attributes Inc. aims to equip policymakers and community planners with a more accurate and functional understanding of economic thresholds, fostering more effective development strategies and interventions tailored to the unique needs of different Washington communities.\n"
