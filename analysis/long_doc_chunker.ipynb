      " PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND \n",
      " \n",
      "The Washington Department of Commerce, hereafter called \"COMMERCE,” has initiated this Request \n",
      "for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from qualified applicants to conduct a study of current and \n",
      "alternative methods for calculating average median household income in Washington state. This work \n",
      "will be in support of the proviso below. \n",
      " \n",
      "At the conclusion of the 2024 session, the Washington State Legislature enacted in law an operating \n",
      "supplemental budget (ESSB 5950) that contains the following direct appropriation: \n",
      " \n",
      "Proviso – Section 127:  (140) $250,000 of the general fund-state appropriation for fiscal year 2025 \n",
      "is provided solely for the department to evaluate alternative methods for calculating average \n",
      "median household income. The department must include in its evaluation the feasibility of using \n",

      " \n",
      "1. Stakeholder Engagement: The consultant will engage with various stakeholders to \n",
      "understand overall interests, concerns, and suggestions for both current and alternative \n",
      "AMI calculation methods. Stakeholders will include, but are not limited to, the Washington \n",

      "baseline for comparison. This objective will involve the following key activities: \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Data Collection: Relevant data will be collected to apply each alternative calculation \n",
